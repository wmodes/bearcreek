# Bear Creek
*Version 2.0.1*

Bear Creek is interactive fiction, a coming-of-age story from a child’s point-of-view.

> *Bear Creek, August 1975.*

> *Looking back, it was that summer, or maybe just that one day that changed everything. KC and the Sunshine Band was on the radio and you were eight years old. A curious daydreamer, on the verge of learning what lay beyond the boundaries of your own little world, and nothing was certain about whether you’d survive the journey.*

## The Game

Here you can play the story online, super convenient, but not my recommendation.

While playing in a browser is certainly convenient, it is typographically painful to this author.  A better alternative is to download software that presents interactive fictions on your desktop.  I highly recommend the typographically beautiful Lectrote which can play a whole host of different format IF games. This is a bit more complicated, but in my opinion, well worth it.

1. Download and install [Lectrote](https://github.com/erkyrath/lectrote/releases), available for Linux, Mac and PC.
2. Download the Bear Creek story file (available soon)
3. Run the story file with Lectote.

## Soundtrack

Feel free to listen to this four hour soundtrack created especially for Bear Creek while you play.

## A Word for Newbies

If you are new to parser-based interactive fiction, you may be challenged in interesting ways. I’d suggest you take a look at the [“A Beginner's Guide to Interactive Fiction,”](http://www.brasslantern.org/beginners/beginnersguide.html) a brief tutorial on playing interactive fiction. You can find it easily from the game screen by clicking on the Home Page link on the left. That might help some. From there, you’ll also see I’ve made the source code available if you care to geek out over that.

Also, here's a handy cheat sheet:

Traditionally, in parser-based fiction there are puzzles that occasionally challenge your progress through the narrative. Many IF authors (including this one) think puzzles can get in the way of the narrative.  That said, Bear Creek has some features that may be considered very very light puzzles. My best suggestion is this: Try your best to inhabit the world and the player character, forgetting best you can that this is a “game.”
