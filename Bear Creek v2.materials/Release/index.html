<div class="about"><span><p>Bear Creek, August 1975.</p><p>Looking back, it was that summer, or maybe just that one day that changed everything. KC and the Sunshine Band was on the radio and you were eight years old. A curious daydreamer, on the verge of learning what lay beyond the boundaries of your own little world, and nothing was certain about whether you'd survive the journey.</p></span></div>

<div class="playinfo">
